======= PROJECT DETAILS =======
Screens:
  Login Screen:
  - Simple menu set up with username and password entry to access the rest of the system
  Ordering Screens:
  - Split among a few different screens with common features of live order list and buttons leading to other administrator menus above. Also contains a nav bar below the adminstrator buttons for access to other 
    screens
    Menu Screen:
    - The basic items sold at [insert company name], when clicked on items are added to the order list.]
    Meal Screen:
    - A separate screen accessed from the nav bar that has pre-made meals that will be added to the order list when clicked on. These meals once added to the order list can be edited, but no editing options
      exist on the meal screen. The meal screen is entirely just to show popular meals that can save time on the ordering process, and to pad out our screen amount ;)
    [ more can be added idk yet tho ]
  Sales Screen:
  - Provides information on all aspects of store sales, daily, weekly, monthly, graphs showing performance throughout a day of the store being open, etc. This menu changes based on the level of authority the user
    has.
  Product Screen:
  - Provides information on all items and their amounts currently available to be sold at the store. Contains multiple options to view details about each item as well as view metrics for amount of certain products
    being used over given periods. Updates accordingly when an order is processed by a user.
  Settings Screen:
